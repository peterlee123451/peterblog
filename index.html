<p>I don't think this will become a blog. Probably a cesspool of my failures.</P>

<h1>I honestly don't know what the fuck to talk about.
Should I just spam memes?</h1>
<h1>Fuck it I'm starting a Joseph Gordon-Levitt fanclub</h1>
<h2>WHY JOSEPH GORDON-LEVITT IS THE MOST HANDSOME MALE ON EARTH</h2>
<p>I'm sorry Leo/Tom/John fans. But obviously Joseph Gordon-Levitt is the most handsome creature
  which crawls on this planet.</p>
  <h3>OKAY ACTUALLY GONNA EXPLAIN THIS FR</h3>
  <p>1. The facial structure</p>
  <img src="joseph1.jpeg" alt="josephgordon-levitthottie" class="centre" style="Width:290px;Height:416px">
  <p>Alright. I'm no expert on facial structure, but man I sometimes just sit down to marvel
    at this man's pure alpha energy. Just looking at his face makes my libido levels skyrocket.
    If you ever have an erectile disfunctions, just join the club. You'll be in and out in no time. </p>
    <h1>Hate to break it to ya. But Joseph Gordon-Levitt is kinda not hot. He may be handsome but not hot. I'd give him a solid 9.2334556638982938723/10</h1>
    <h1>BUT. PHIL SWIFT IS HOT.</h1>
    <img src="philswift.jpg" alt="philswift" class="centre">
    <h2>Alright so you may be wondering why Phil Swift is hot.</h2>
    <p>Well. First of all he is like MacGyver. Except better. Yesturday he was on a
      commercial. Now he's a trained astronaut. Honestly, Phil is catching up to the meta stage of
      Johnny sins. Johnny Sins is overqualified for the planet. he can be a taxi driver, a property agent, a teacher,
      an actor, AN ASTRONAUT (super cool), a retired war veteran, a chef and of course a teenager. These are some qualities
      a man must have to be considered hot. However, Johnny sins is not hot. Bc he just isn't lol. Since I have labeled some qualities, you cannot possibly
      judge me for being subjective.</p>
      <h1>Should Ben Shapiro artificially inseminate every single person above the age 24?</h1>
<img src="benshapiro.jpg" alt="Ben (daddy) Shapiro" class="centre">
<p>My bet is probably not. Many will argue that he should. Since his legal name is Ben (daddy) Shapiro, which was given to him by the Queen.
  But think about all the human rights infringment that the UN will ignore. Shame.</p>
